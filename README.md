## Project Description
### **FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM**
We wish to tackle the Problem Statement of "Behavioural Analytics for Security in Financial Transactions".

4.7 Trillion Dollars! That is the amount of revenue lost every year due to fraudsters. Astonishingly, 93% of banking-related fraud happens online. This shows the pressing need for an improved Anomaly Detection System. 

To tackle this problem, we propose a **three-pronged solution**: 
1. **Prevention:** We will create an Android Application with inbuilt Spam and Phishing detection, to protect the user from any harm from the beginning. 
2. **Detection:** The Main Website will connect to a database and a fraud detection model. It will classify whether the transaction is a fraud or not 
3. **Mitigation:** Additionally, the webpage will return the GeoLocation of the IP Address. We will also be storing the details to perform Social Network Analysis on the transaction to identify patterns. 

Our Innovations: 
1. **GeoSpatial Analysis:** Utilizing IP-based location distance metrics for geographical analysis. 
2. **Real-time Network Analysis:** Analyzes financial transactions in real-time for enhanced security. 
3. **Crypto-Based Authentication:** Implements a hash-based authentication (Zero-Knowledge Protocol) for secure user login. 
4. **Phishing and Spam Detection** on the Edge
